## 🚀 Quick Start (Docker-first)

**Requirements:** Docker, Docker Compose

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AlexFilippov-it/wrighttest.git
cd wrighttest

cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env - set JWT_SECRET to a long random string (required)

docker compose up --build
```

| Service | URL |
|---|---|
| App | http://localhost:5173 |
| API | http://localhost:3000 |
| noVNC | http://localhost:6080 |

Default admin login is defined in `.env`:

- `ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@wrighttest.app`
- `ADMIN_PASSWORD=changeme`

On an empty database the seed also creates a `Docker Demo` project with two sample tests, a `DEV` environment, a `Smoke Test` suite, and an hourly schedule.

This path is the recommended first launch on any machine. The backend image is built on the Playwright-ready base image and includes the browser bundle, so no host browser or system library setup is required.

## 🐳 Docker Hub Images

WrightTest is a multi-container stack. Docker Hub publishes the WrightTest-owned application images, while PostgreSQL and Redis continue to use official upstream images:

- `wrighttest/wrighttest-backend`
- `wrighttest/wrighttest-frontend`
- `wrighttest/wrighttest-novnc`
- `postgres:16-alpine`
- `redis:7-alpine`

Run the published images without rebuilding locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AlexFilippov-it/wrighttest.git
cd wrighttest

cp .env.example .env
# Set JWT_SECRET to a long random string.

docker compose -f docker-compose.hub.yml pull
docker compose -f docker-compose.hub.yml up -d
```

Use `WRIGHTTEST_IMAGE_NAMESPACE` and `WRIGHTTEST_IMAGE_TAG` to select another Docker Hub namespace or version:

```env
WRIGHTTEST_IMAGE_NAMESPACE=your-dockerhub-org
WRIGHTTEST_IMAGE_TAG=0.2.0
```

The regular `docker-compose.yml` remains the source-of-truth development compose file and builds the same image names from the current Git checkout. `docker-compose.hub.yml` is the pull-only runtime variant for Docker Hub users.

Frontend URLs are runtime-configured in the container through:

- `VITE_BACKEND_URL`
- `VITE_NOVNC_URL`
- `VITE_ENABLE_NOVNC`

This keeps published frontend images reusable across localhost, VPS, and reverse-proxy deployments without rebuilding the frontend for each public URL.

Docker image metadata includes OCI labels pointing back to:

- https://wrighttest.com
- https://github.com/AlexFilippov-it/wrighttest

## 🌐 Live Demo

A public demo UI is available at:

- https://demo.wrighttest.com

Demo credentials:

- Email: `demo@wrighttest.com`
- Password: `demo`

The demo account has read-only access only.

## 🖥 Server Prerequisites

For a VPS or bare-metal deploy, make sure these are available first:

- Docker Engine
- Docker Compose V2 (`docker compose`)
- a reverse proxy such as nginx if you want a public domain
- free host ports for the published services if you are not proxying everything through nginx

Recommended Docker overrides for a server deploy:

- `FRONTEND_HOST_PORT`
- `BACKEND_HOST_PORT`
- `POSTGRES_HOST_PORT`
- `REDIS_HOST_PORT`
- `VNC_HOST_PORT`
- `NOVNC_HOST_PORT`

Keep container-internal ports unchanged; only adjust the host-facing ports and public URLs when needed.

## 🚀 Server Deployment

For a server deployment:

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Set `JWT_SECRET` to a long random value
3. Set `FRONTEND_URL` to your public domain or reverse-proxy URL
4. Set `VITE_BACKEND_URL` and `VITE_NOVNC_URL` to the URLs users should reach from the browser
   - local example: `http://localhost:6080`
   - reverse-proxy example: `/vnc`
5. Adjust `*_HOST_PORT` values if your VPS already uses ports like `3000`, `5432`, or `6379`
6. Run `docker compose up --build -d`

If you place nginx in front of the app, proxy the public frontend domain to the frontend container and route backend/API traffic to the backend container. The backend already exposes `/health` and `/health/db` for readiness checks.

## noVNC Local / Server Modes

WrightTest uses a single `VITE_NOVNC_URL` value and derives the websocket path from it at runtime.

### Local Development

Use this when noVNC is exposed directly on `localhost`:

```env
VITE_NOVNC_URL=http://localhost:6080
```

The recorder iframe connects to:

- `ws://localhost:6080/websockify`

### Server Behind Reverse Proxy

Use this when nginx exposes noVNC under a path prefix:

```env
VITE_NOVNC_URL=/vnc
```

The recorder iframe connects to:

- `wss://your-domain.example/vnc/websockify`

This keeps the container image unchanged and moves the deployment-specific part into configuration only.

## 🤖 AI Quick Start

If you are working with an AI coding agent, start here first:

- [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md)

It contains the canonical repo workflow, startup order, and environment rules for WrightTest.

## 🛠 Host Fallback (optional)

Use this only if you want to run the frontend with Vite and the backend on the host.

**Requirements:** Node.js 20+, PostgreSQL 16, Redis 7

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AlexFilippov-it/wrighttest.git
cd wrighttest

cp .env.example .env
# Edit DATABASE_URL for local PostgreSQL

npm install
npm run setup
cd backend && npx prisma migrate dev && npx prisma db seed && cd ..
npm run dev
```

`npm install` now runs a Playwright bootstrap step for Chromium and WebKit. On Ubuntu/Linux
it will also try to install system dependencies when the terminal session allows
it. If Playwright still cannot launch Chromium or mobile recording needs WebKit,
run the same bootstrap manually and then install Linux deps:

```bash
npm run setup
npx playwright install chromium webkit
sudo npx playwright install-deps chromium webkit
```

| Service | URL |
|---|---|
| Frontend | http://localhost:5173 |
| Backend | http://localhost:3000 |

If the host environment still reports missing Playwright libraries, rerun `npm run setup` once from the repo root. On Ubuntu/Linux this may fall back to `npx playwright install-deps chromium webkit` when needed.

## 🔄 Updating

```bash
git pull
docker compose up --build -d
```

On first launch or after resetting volumes:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Make sure JWT_SECRET is set to a long random value
docker compose up --build -d
```

Migrations apply automatically on startup. Existing projects, tests and run history are preserved in the Postgres volume.

## 🔧 Changing Ports

All ports are in `.env` - no hardcoded values in code:

```env
BACKEND_PORT=3001
FRONTEND_PORT=8080
NOVNC_PORT=6081
```

Then restart:

```bash
docker compose up --build -d
```

## 🧪 Data-driven Checks

WrightTest separates checks from test cases:

- **Check** - one browser scenario: URL, device, and steps.
- **Test case** - one named set of scenario variables for that check.
- **Run** - one execution of one check with one selected test case.
- **Run batch** - a grouped set of runs created by running all enabled test cases for one check.

This means a project can show `Checks: 1` while that check contains multiple test cases. The check is counted once because the browser flow and steps are shared; each enabled case creates its own run when executed in a batch.

Each test case has:

- a human-readable name
- an enabled/disabled state
- scenario variables such as `EMAIL`, `PASS`, `EXPECTED_MESSAGE`, or `EXPECTED_URL`

All variables are equal: they can describe form input, expected results, URLs, titles, search text, order numbers, or any other scenario value. Use them in the Start URL or step fields with the same `{{VARIABLE}}` syntax used by environments.

Example case:

```text
Wrong password
EMAIL=admin@test.com
PASS=123456
EXPECTED_MESSAGE=Invalid email or password
EXPECTED_URL=https://demo.wrighttest.com/login
```

Example steps:

```text
Fill {{EMAIL}}
Fill {{PASS}}
Assert text {{EXPECTED_MESSAGE}}
Assert URL {{EXPECTED_URL}}
```

For manual runs in the editor, select the case in **Check settings** next to the Environment selector, then run the check. If more than one case is enabled, use **Run all enabled cases** to queue a batch. Each case in that batch creates a separate `TestRun`, keeps its own variable snapshot, screenshots, trace, error, and step results, and runs through the existing worker.

On the project checks page, **Run** is data-aware: checks with one enabled case start a normal run; checks with multiple enabled cases queue a batch and open the batch result page.

WrightTest combines variables from the selected environment with variables from the selected test data case for that run. Test data case variables take precedence when the same variable name exists in both places. Empty strings are valid values, so a case can intentionally define `EMAIL=`.

Disabled cases are ignored by run actions and do not block variable diagnostics.

This keeps ordinary checks unchanged: if a check has no test data, it runs exactly as before.

## 🖥 Devices

If no device is selected, WrightTest uses the default desktop browser context (`1280x720`). The device selector only stores explicit overrides such as:

- `Desktop 1280px`
- `Desktop 1920px (HiDPI)`
- mobile and tablet presets from Playwright

There is no separate saved value for "Desktop default"; leaving the selector empty is the default desktop mode.
